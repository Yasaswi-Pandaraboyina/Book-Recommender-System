# Book-Recommender-System
This project is a book recommender system that suggests books based on users' preferences. It uses collaborative filtering with cosine similarity to find similar users and calculates weighted ratings for books theyâ€™ve read. It then recommends the top 5 unread books, with results saved in a CSV file.
